<p>Chickens are a large part of modern society as they provide large chain restaurants with the food that a large population takes for granted every time you go to a fast food restaurant. Many people have them as pets and harvest their eggs, and many more live on farms to provide a food source for the main populace.</p>

<p>From social media all the way to your very own kitchen, chicken has been some part of your life. Even withholding from chicken itself is a lifestyle that has formed large communities of vegetarians and vegans. Since everyone has to have caloric intake to survive their life, it has rightfully so taken over a major hunk of our lifestyles.</p>
