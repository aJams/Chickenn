<h2>Chickens are raised as sources of food and as pets.</h2>

<p>Chickens are a large part of modern society as they provide large chain restaurants with the food that a large population takes for granted every time you go to a fast food restaurant.

<h2>Chickens are life!</h2>

<p>From social media all the way to your very own kitchen, chicken has been some part of your life. Even withholding from chicken itself is a lifestyle that has formed large communities of vegetarians and vegans. Since everyone has to have caloric intake to survive their life, it has rightfully so taken over a major hunk of our lifestyles.</p>
